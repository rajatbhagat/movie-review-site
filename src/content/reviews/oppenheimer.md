Christopher Nolan's *Oppenheimer* is a masterful biographical epic that examines the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project during World War II.

## A Technical Marvel

The film's use of IMAX cameras and practical effects creates an immersive experience unlike anything else in recent cinema. The Trinity test sequence is nothing short of breathtaking—Nolan's decision to create the explosion practically rather than with CGI pays off tremendously.

## Cillian Murphy's Career-Defining Performance

Murphy embodies Oppenheimer with a haunting intensity. His hollow eyes and gaunt frame capture a man simultaneously brilliant and tortured, convinced of his mission yet aware of its terrible implications.

## The Sound Design

Ludwig Göransson's score is both beautiful and terrifying, perfectly complementing the film's themes of creation and destruction. The way sound drops out during key moments creates unbearable tension.

## The Verdict

*Oppenheimer* isn't just a great film—it's an important one. It asks us to reckon with the moral complexities of scientific progress and the weight of decisions that shape human history. At three hours, it demands your attention, but rewards it generously.

**Recommended for:** History buffs, Nolan fans, and anyone interested in thoughtful, ambitious filmmaking.
