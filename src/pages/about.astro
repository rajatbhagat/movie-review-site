        Welcome to CineReview, your trusted source for thoughtful, honest movie reviews.
        We believe that great cinema deserves more than a simple thumbs up or down.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        In a world of endless streaming options and countless new releases,
        finding movies worth your time can be overwhelming. That's where we come in.
        Our mission is to help you discover films that will truly move, entertain,
        and inspire you.
      </p>

      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <p>
        We don't just rate movies—we explore them. Each review dives into the
        storytelling, performances, cinematography, and what makes a film tick.
        Whether it's a blockbuster or an indie gem, we approach every movie
        with the same level of care and analysis.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Rating System</h2>
      <p>
        We use a 10-point scale that accounts for all aspects of filmmaking:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>9-10:</strong> Masterpiece - A must-watch that will stay with you</li>
        <li><strong>7-8:</strong> Great - Highly recommended with minor flaws</li>
        <li><strong>5-6:</strong> Good - Worth watching if you enjoy the genre</li>
        <li><strong>3-4:</strong> Below Average - Some redeeming qualities</li>
        <li><strong>1-2:</strong> Skip It - Not worth your time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>
